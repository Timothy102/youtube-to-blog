## On Investing and Market Timing



- Market timing is less important for early stage investing, which is about 10 year trends

- Recessions are inevitable over a 10 year period, like bad weather when sailing

- Focus on whether an industry will be much larger in 10 years, not short-term fluctuations



## People vs. Market

- Both the team and the market opportunity are important factors in investing

- A great team going after a terrible market opportunity will struggle

- Look for a combination of a very good person and a thesis you believe in



## Lessons from Failures



- Past mistakes can influence future decision making, even if you try to avoid it

- Mature industries like e-commerce and media are challenging for new entrants

- Opportunities exist in B2B where there are fundamental changes in science or regulation



## Adding Value as an Investor

- 90% of a company's value comes from the CEO and team

- Hiring the right CEO is the most important decision a board makes

- Early on, investors add value with fundraising, hiring, and outside perspective



## First-Time vs. Serial Founders



- Consumer businesses are often started by first-time founders with high energy

- Enterprise businesses tend to have more repeat founders with industry credibility

- Different industries have different patterns of successful founder backgrounds



## Incubations vs. Investments

- Industry focus enables both starting companies and investing in a sector

- Incubations work when you bring in high quality CEOs with proper incentives

- Resource allocation between incubations and investments is a judgment call



## Pricing and Ownership



- Sometimes you pay a big price because it's an incredible team and opportunity

- Ownership percentage is less important than the quality of the company

- If someone makes you an offer you can't refuse, take it

## On Valuation and Dilution



- Valuation is about the team and market opportunity, not just current metrics

- Take liquidity when you can, but conviction matters for the big wins

- Dilution is a factor, but outlier successes make up for it

## Biggest Misses and Lessons Learned



- Wish I had been more aggressive early on in starting companies

- Evaporating paper gains can be disappointing 

- Do this business because you love it, not for the money



## On Reserves and Selling



- We invest up to $100-200M valuations, then let others take over

- If someone makes an offer you can't refuse, don't refuse it

- Bought Meetup for $10M, sold for 7-8x a few years later

## Venture Today



- There's a bubble of money in venture, more than the industry needs

- Illiquidity is a real concern, IPO markets may stay closed

- Many companies plateau, normal for most not to become huge successes



## Relationship with Money



- Surprisingly little change, not focused on money itself

- Enjoy experiences and travel, but not flashy spending

- Do what you love as long as you can, like a pro athlete

## New York Tech Scene



- Has grown incredibly, outperforming all expectations 

- Will likely have more tech jobs than SF within 15 years

- Centralization of AI talent in SF, but NY attracting top university grads



## Concerns and Outlook



- Most concerned about a Trump re-election

- We'll keep investing as we have been, maybe bigger in deep tech

- Live life enjoying it - investing, athletics, Burning Man, family
